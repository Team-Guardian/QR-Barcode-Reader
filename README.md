# QR-Barcode-Reader
This is the second version of the QR code scanner for machine vision. 

What the code does
Accesses your computers camera and reads QR codes from the individual frames. Highlights in green if the string encoded 
in the QR code matches the one inputted (this is inputted from the command line). Highlights in red if the string does not
match. All QR codes found within your camera's view are logged into a csv file named barcodes.csv. Two test qr codes have 
also been added, one says test, the other team_guardian.
